MNCMP
=====
mncmp() is a simple function using the python NLTK library that attempts to determine whether its first and second natural-language arguments have (approximately) the same meaning. For now, the function mainly uses wordnet.path_similarity to "cross-off" words which have roughly the same meaning/some close relation. This is of course very primitive but for simple sentences it works quite well.

Usage : mncmp(argument_1,argument_2), argument_1 and argument_2 being raw text data (==strings, not processed with nltk.word_tokenize etc., this is done inside the function)

Return value : True if the meanings were determined to be approximately the same, False otherwise.


PRETZEL
=======
Pretzel is a simple wrapper around mncmp() creating the illusion of an Artificial Intelligence assistant. It was inspired by Lexion's Cookie (bbs.archlinux.org), but it focuses mainly on identifying similar meanings with the mncmp() function rather than providing many functions (these can be added easily later anyway).
Therefore, Pretzel has only two modes of "responding" as of now:
  - simple text response
  - the running of a shell command (in the background)
To teach Pretzel something new, simply enter the sentence which should trigger the new action, and then enter the appropriate command; either the text of a simple text reply or /shell command args for running command with args (in the background, a & is automatically appended).
